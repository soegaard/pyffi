@;local-table-of-contents[]


@section[#:tag "introduction"]{Introduction}

The library @tt{pyffi} makes it possible to use Python libraries from Racket.

The bridge between Racket and Python is for now one-way only: a Racket
program can call Python function and invoke Python methods, but it's not possible (yet)
to pass Racket functions to the Python side.

Python libraries implemented in Python ought to work out of the box.

Python libraries implemented as C extensions might work - if the C
extension supports introspection via the Python module `inspect`. For
C extensions without introspection you can drop down to a low-level
FFI which works in the same style as the Racket C FFI.

Bindings for @tt{Numpy}, the popular package for numerical calculations, are provided.


@section[#:tag "release-information"]{Release Information}

This is the first release of the library, so be prepared to deal with
some rough edges here and there.

Report bugs to the @tt{pyffi} Github repository: @|pyffi-github|.

If you run into any questions, use the forum
@hyperlink["https://racket.discourse.group/"]{Racket Discourse}.

Alternatively, feel free to ask questions on the chat server 
@hyperlink["https://discord.com/invite/6Zq8sH5"]{Racket Discord}.


@section[#:tag "supported-platforms"]{Supported Platforms}

For now @tt{pyffi} supports Python 3.10 on macOS, Linux/Unix and Windows.


@section[#:tag "installation"]{Installation}

The plan is simple: install Python 3.10 then tell @tt{pyffi} where
Python is installed.

Optional: install @hyperlink["https://numpy.org/"]{NumPy} if you want
to use @racket[pyffi/numpy].


@subsection{Python 3.10}

In order to use @tt{pyffi} you need Python 3.10.

The official distribution of Python is here:
@hyperlink["https://www.python.org/downloads/"]{https://www.python.org/downloads/}

If you prefer to use an alternative source of distribution
(read your favorite package manager), that's fine too - as long as it
includes both the standard interpreter as well as the shared library @tt{libpython}.

@subsection{One-time Configuration}

The last installation step consists of telling @tt{pyffi} where your
shared library @tt{libpython} is placed.

The easiest way of doing this is to run the script @tt{configure-pyffi}.

@itemlist[
          @item{Open a terminal.}
          @item{Check that @tt{python3} or @tt{python} invokes your Python interpreter.@linebreak[]}
          @item{Run: @tt{raco pyffi configure}}]

If the command @tt{python3} is not in your path, then you can write this instead:

@itemlist[
          @item{@tt{raco pyffi configure <path-to-your-python-command>}}]

This will find the location of your shared library, print it, and,
store it in your Racket preferences under the key @tt{pyffi:libdir}.

You are now ready to use @tt{pyffi}.


@subsection{Optional: @tt{NumPy} for scientific computing}

The Python package NumPy has the slogan:

@nested[#:style 'inset]{The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.}

If you want to use @tt{pyffi/numpy} then you need to install @tt{NumPy}
in your Python environment first.

There are many ways of installing @tt{NumPy}, but the simplest is to use
the following in a terminal:

@itemlist[
          @item{@tt{python3 -m pip install numpy}}]



@section{An introduction to @tt{pyffi}}

The @tt{pyffi} library makes it possible to use Python libraries from a Racket program.

A Racket program can start a Python process by requiring @racket[pyffi] and calling
@racket[initialize]. After the initialization @racket[run] and @racket[run*] can
be used to evaluate expressions and statements in the Python process.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (require pyffi)
          (initialize)
          (run "1+2")]

Here Racket starts an embed Python process.
The Python "1+2" is parsed, compiled and evaluated by Python.
The resulting Python value 3 is then converted examples into the Racket value 3.

@subsection{Atomic values: numbers, booleans and @tt{None}}

Atomic Python values (numbers, booleans and None) are automatically converted
to their corresponding Racket values.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (require pyffi)
          (initialize)
          (run "12")
          (run "34.")
          (run "5+6j")
          (run "False")
          (run "True")
          (list (run "None"))]

@subsection{Compound Values: strings, tuples, lists, and, dictionaries}

Compound (non-atomic) Python values such as strings, tuples, lists and dicts are not converted
to Racket values. Instead they are wrapped in a struct named #racket[obj].
Due to a custom printer handler these wrapped values print nicely.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (run "'Hello World'")
          (run "(1,2,3)")
          (run "[1,2,3]")
          (run "{'a': 1, 'b': 2}")]

The values display nicely too:

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (displayln (run "'Hello World'"))
          (displayln (run "(1,2,3)"))
          (displayln (run "[1,2,3]"))
          (displayln (run "{'a': 1, 'b': 2}"))]


Printing and displaying a Python object use the
@python-docs["object.__repr__"]{__repr__} and @python-docs["object.__str__"]{__str__}
methods of the object respectively.

The idea is that Racket gains four new data types: @tt{pystring}, @tt{tuple}, 
@tt{pylist} and @tt{dict}. @margin-note{Conversion between hash tables and dicts
needs to be implemented, before it can be used in the introduction}
                                                   
To convert a compound value use @racket[pystring->string], @racket[tuple->vector]
or @racket[pylist->list].

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (pystring->string (run "'Hello World'"))
          (tuple->vector (run "(1,2,3)"))
          (pylist->list (run "[1,2,3]"))]

Similarly, you can convert Racket values to Python ones.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (string->pystring "Hello World")
          (vector->tuple #(1 2 3))
          (list->pylist '(1 2 3))]

It's important to note that creating Python values using
@racket[string->pystring], @racket[vector->tuple] and @racket[list->pylist]
is much more efficient that using @racket[run]. The overhead of @racket[run]
is due to the parsing and compiling of its its input string. In contrast
@racket[string->pystring] and friends use the C API to create the
Python values directly.

The data types have also have constructors:

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (pystring #\H #\e #\l #\l #\o)
          (tuple 1 2 3)
          (pylist 1 2 3)]

The new types @tt{pystring}, @tt{tuple} and @tt{pylist} can be used with @racket[for].

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (for/list ([x (in-pystring (string->pystring "Hello"))]) x)
          (for/list ([x (in-tuple (vector->tuple #(1 2 3)))]) x)
          (for/list ([x (in-pylist (list->pylist '(1 2 3)))]) x)]


@subsection{Builtin functions and modules}

@margin-note{Use @racket[run] for expressions and @racket[run*] for statements.}
The previous sections showed how to evaluate expressions using the Python interpreter.
Now we will look at statements.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (run* "x = 1+2")]

Here the statement @tt{x = 1+2} is parsed, compiled and executed.
The result of the expression @tt{1+2} is stored in the global variable @tt{x}.

To retrieve the value of the Python variable @tt{x} we could use @racket[run]:
@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (run "x")]

But due to the overhead of @racket[run] it is better to make a direct
variable reference.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          main.x]

Here @tt{main} is the name we have given to the module used for the 
global namespace of the Python interpreter. The dotted identifier @tt{main.x}
thus references the variable @tt{x} in the global namespace.

@margin-note{The import is done with @linebreak[] @tt{import builtins}}
In a standard Python interpreter nothing is imported when the interpreter
is started, but with @racket[pyffi] the module @python-docs["builtins"]{builtins}
is imported at startup. 

Since Python modules are first class values, we can see their printed 
representations:

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          main
          builtins]

@margin-note{Table of @hyperlink["https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html"]{Built-in functions}}
The module @tt{builtins} is also how we access the built-in Python functions.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (builtins.abs -7)
          (builtins.list "Hello")
          (builtins.range 2 5)
          (builtins.list (builtins.range 2 5))]

If you find the name @tt{builtins} too long, then you can give it a new, shorter name.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (define b builtins)
          (b.abs -7)]

If you access the @tt{abs} functions directly, you get a callable object:

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          b.abs]

A callable object can be used just like a normal Racket function:

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (map b.abs '(1 -2 3 -4))]

To use functions from the Python standard library, you need to import it before
you can use it. The standard library @python-docs["sys"]{sys} provide
a lot of system information. Let's use it to find the version of the Python interpreter.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (import sys)
          sys.version_info]

The list of modules in
@hyperlink["https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"]{The Python Standard Library}
is long, so let's just try one more.

We want to print a text calendar for the current month.

@margin-note{Documentation for @hyperlink["https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html"]{@tt{calendar}}.}
@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (import calendar)
          (calendar.TextCalendar)
          (displayln ((calendar.TextCalendar) .formatmonth 2022 7))]

The expression @tt{(calendar.TextCalendar)} instantiates a @tt{TextCalendar} object.
The syntax @tt{(object .method arg ...)} is used to invoke the method @tt{formatmonth}
with the arguments 2022 and 7 (for July).

The documentation for @tt{formatmonth} shows its signature:

@centered{@tt{formatmonth(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)}}

The two first arguments @tt{theyear} and @tt{themonth} are postional arguments
and the two last arguments @tt{w} and @tt{l} are keyword arguments both has
0 has as default value.

The keyword argument @tt{w} specifies the width of the date columns.
We can get full names of the week days with a width of 9.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (displayln ((calendar.TextCalendar) .formatmonth 2022 7 #:w 9))]


@subsection{Exceptions}

An exception on the Python side is converted to an exception on the Racket side.
The exception will be printed with a full traceback.

@examples[#:label #f #:eval pe
          (eval:error (run "1/0"))]
